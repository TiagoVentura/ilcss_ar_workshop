- Introduction to Data Manipulation with dplyr. ([Slides](https://tiagoventura.github.io/ilcss_ar_workshop/slides/intro_tidyverse_ilcss_ar.Rmd) / [R Code](./code/intro_r_ilcss_ar.r) / [Exercise]())


## Materials

All the materials are available in this repo. If you are familiar with git, you can just clone this repository locally, and get access to everything in just one place.

## About me

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Government and Politics at the University of Maryland. I research on comparative politics and computational social science, with a particular focus on political violence in Latin America and political communication. Before moving to Marylan, I got a Masters and a Doctorate in Political Science at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 

You can find more about my research on my [website](http://tiagoventura.rbind.io/)

During the years of my Ph.D. at Maryland, I had the amazing opportunity to work as a researcher at the iLCSS Maryland under the supervision of Ernesto Calvo. This experience was fundamental for my learning process during the PhD, but also fundamentallu shaped of my research agenda in political communication. The iLCSS also gave me the opportunity to have Ernesto as my mentor and co-author on several projects, and for this it is a honor to be here with you today!

There are a hell lot of materials out there and for free that you can use to dig deeper on your learning process in R. Here are some of my favorites.
